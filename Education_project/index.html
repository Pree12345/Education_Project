            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. </p>

                Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach,
                in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and
                all the other aspects of the operation. Hence, the differentiation between government schools and
                private schools can be misleading.[22] However, in a report by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon entitled: The
                emptying of public Schools and growth of private schools in India, it is said that For sensible
                education policy making, it is vital to take account of the changing trends in the size of the private
                and public schooling sectors in India. Ignoring these trends involves the risk of poor
                policies/legislation, with attendant adverse consequences for children's life chances.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Poorly resourced public schools which suffer from high rates of teacher
                absenteeism may have encouraged the rapid growth of private (unaided) schooling in India, particularly
                in urban areas. Private schools divide into two types: recognised and unrecognised schools. Government
                'recognition' is an official stamp of approval and for this a private school is required to fulfil a
                number of conditions, though hardly any private schools that get 'recognition' actually fulfil all the
                conditions of recognition. The emergence of large numbers of unrecognised primary schools suggests that
                schools and parents do not take government recognition as a stamp of quality.</p>
